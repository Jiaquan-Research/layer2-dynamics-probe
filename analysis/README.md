# Analysis Utilities

This directory contains offline tools for analyzing
Layer-2 dynamical logs generated by `llm_probe/run.py`.

These scripts do not run inference and do not modify models.
They operate purely on recorded logs.

Typical workflow:
1. Run experiments (`llm_probe/run.py`)
2. Save stdout to a log file
3. Parse and visualize phase-space trajectories
